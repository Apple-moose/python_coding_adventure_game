situations = {
    "start": "So, here you are again, laptop in hands. You start to WRITE CODE",
    "first options": "You gather your focus and put your mind at work with confidence. Right away, your flow gets interrrupted by this damn 'meanError' again\
...Time to make a decision: You turn to GOOGLE (STACK overflow, or chatGPT?), talk to the DUCK or walk to the KITCHEN? (you can always call a FRIEND for a quick fix)",
    "stack overflow": "You end up scrolling again on Stack Overflow, your most trusted friend on the web. There are tons of solutions \
exposed on many pages but, somehow, it's all gibberish, nothing is usable...At this point, be honest: you start building internal FRUSTRATION or \
you calmly turn to other ressources and STUDY some more? Call a FRIEND? open CHATGPT? (you could always SLEEP on it...)",
    "duck": "You look around and make eye contact with the rubber duck on your desk. You are well aware of the magic involved in \
RUBBER DUCKING. The question is: do you really believe in it? The duck looks back at you faithfully, listening...What are you going to do: try to EXPLAIN your coding problems \
to Donald or don't be a fool and re-consider your OPTIONS?",
    "rubber ducking": "In software engineering, rubber duck debugging (or rubberducking) is a method of debugging code by articulating a \
problem in spoken or written natural language. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer \
would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line by line, to the duck (press B+A+C+K, in that order with a fingers \
on the keyboard. Then with the same finger or another press <enter>...)",
    "kitchen": "Let's get some air in the lungs and refill your energy levels. What's the rush anyways? You walk \
to the kitchen slowly, thinking about what you will find there...You take the opportunity to drink a bit of water and \
end up fighting yourself a little over that box on the counter with a big 'Merci' written on it... Steal some CHOCOLATE or \
BACK to work?",
    "tea": "You wipe away the brown from the corners of your smiling mouth and notice the water boiler. Now, how about preparing \
yourself a nice cup of TEA? Maybe eat another piece of CHOCOLATE? ..or BACK to work for some reason...???",
    "sandwich": "Waiting for the water to boil, you prepare your cup and check in the fridge for some cream. You \
think about going BACK to work...also, you can't help but notice all the necessary ingredients to make yourself one of your favorite SANDWICH. Again: 'What's \
the rush, right? Very tempting. It would sure take your belly out of the equation in your next coding session...",
    "break": "There it is: true pleasure. A Happy brain in an Happy body. What more? Well, how about a little BREAK for \
digestion purposes? (or BACK to work.... Really??)",
    "after break": "Ouh, time passes so fast when your checking for new shoes on amazon! Fine, let's go BACK to coding, \
but not before you pass by the W.C., check your hair and your teeth in the mirror, put on a warm shirt, make yourself \
another TEA, grab some CHOCOLATE...",
    "call_friend": "After a couple of calls, someone from the inner circle picks up, laughs at you a little and says that he will send you the much needed \
lines of code through GitHUb. Smart move buddy, you congratulate yourself for not wasting time and/or not learning much...",
    "chatgpt": "Takes a couple of tweeking in the prompting but, as intended, the Truth appears before your eyes: pure code, \
devoid of humanity and predictable variable names. The code is unreadable but, who are you to stand in the middle of computers \
helping each other so efficiently? Smart move. Just don't tell anyone what you've done and earn yourself more time to spend on more entertaining stuff! \
Life is not that hard right? Will you ever CODE again, QUIT this nonsensical absurdity of a mini game, or check updates \
on your coder's PROFILE?",
    "frustration": "HOOOOOOLLLY COW!!! Computers are so incredibly AUTISTIC! You realize at this instant how much you were not \
made to work in a mental institution...but you might become a patient if you let all this anger control yourself! \
You take a second to contemplate this issue: and decide to come BACK and evaluate this situation calmly, or, turn to \
the DARK side and express some of that accumulated tension physically?",
    "dark": "Something has got to give and various options are rapidly presenting themselves: you can SCREAM in a pillow, let a very long and very loud F-WORD out, \
SLAP something on the desk or just PUNCH that wall with all you've got...",
    "pillow": "After this mini crisis episode, you go and refresh your face in the bathroom. Once the mirror-check \
reflects your normal 'OK' face again, you come back to your post, take a deep breath and start to CODE again...",
    "cursing": "WAouuuuuh that felt good! Sometimes, cursing is all you've got...for now, you're 'OK' (are you? want to 'STOP'?) but you can't shake the feeling that \
you might have been noticed by someone else, and that, makes you want to curse even more. Will you risk another very loud 'FUUU' ??",
    "study": "Zen as a bonsai, you turn to other websites and try not to deviate from the path too much...",
    "study2": "You take a couple of minutes to ponder your options: you can always let it go and SLEEP on it, \
see what tomorrow brings. Also you can OBSESS and stay on course until you make the code work or, \
look inward and see if you are not, in fact, building some kind of FRUSTRATION",
    "obsess": "OK, you got this. Knife between your teeth you try to make it work using the sheer power of your Will",
    "abandon": "You are failing and you know it. There most be a simple explanation, but it is out of reach for the moment. \
Time to lick you wounds, admit defeat and gather your strengh for the next fight. Another day, another code to write....what will you do? \
START AGAIN, meditate on your coder's PROFILE or just QUIT?",
    "sleep": "Time to get your 'Mojo' back, meditate, and experience the cycle of life again. Breathing in and out. This is no lazyness (or is it?). \
This is how the experienced thinker acts: trusting one's brain to classify all the data during its 'reboot phase' and eventually reveal the missing links...",
    "nap success": "What a difference a good nap makes! You haven't touched the keyboard and yet, you are already \
formulating solutions within a smile. Your refreshed self is winning, the rest bears its fruit. You feel wiser and a little more proficient at coding. How about that?\
 Hopefully it will work NEXT TIME. Or maybe you would like to check updates on your coder's PROFILE?",
    "punch": "You turn to that ugly wall next to the desk and hit it with your right fist. AOUCH!... Damn, \
you have hit precisely where the supporting beam was! Your hand hurts a little and the wall is somehow mocking you. \
What does this experience teaches you? That you need to 'CALM DOWN', or go the toolbox, get the HAMMER and bring that \
stupid wall down?",
    "strangle duck": "You put your hands around the neck of the duck. You start squeezing until you hear a \
'Kwaaaakkk'. You can't help but smile as you see yourself a rubber duck murderer. You squeeze so more, but nothing new \
comes out of this experience and know how childish you have become. Now, where were we? EXPLAIN some more, \
BACK to your code or ABANDON?",
    "slap endgame": "OUch!!! The slapping went uncontrolled and your laptop gets a big hit. Screen of Death and broken glass, \
you are also bleeding at the wrist. What a mess!!! Seriously?? This couldn't have gone worse. \
You are dangerous. This mini game is booting you out as to avoid further material destruction. Good luck with your temper issues Pal!",
    "angry endgame": "With so much noise, someone calls the autorities on you. You get a serious warning and find yourself in such a state of \
anger and despair that you are rendered inoperable. You need to CALM DOWN! Seriously. \
This mini game is booting you out as to avoid further material destruction. Have a nice Life Buddy!",
    "autism": "Autism, also called autism spectrum disorder(ASD) or autism spectrum condition (ASC), is a neurodevelopmental disorder \
marked by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and deficits in reciprocal social communication. Other common signs include perseverative \
interests, stereotypic body movements (stimming), rigid routines, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, and difficulty with social interaction \
and verbal and nonverbal communication. (type 'BACK' exactly, without any mistake or I will not understand!)",
    "success": "OH! You did it! WOW! Impressive. You do a little dance...and just between us: you know it's 3 a.m. right? \
Did you missed that call from your mother? You will probably be coding in bed also, good luck sleeping! \
START again because you are a Maniac or check updates on your coder's PROFILE together?",
    "duck success": "Incredible! Confessional Programming IS an actual working method for debugging and you are now \
living proof of it. Going back to the code, you find that hidden bug and make everything running smoothly again. You feel smart \
and adequate. TODO: Celebrate fully and check updates on your coder's PROFILE or on to the NEXT challenge??",

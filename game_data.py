situations = {
    "start": "So, here you are again, laptop in hands. You start to WRITE CODE",
    "first options": "You gather your focus and put your mind at work with confidence. Right away, your flow gets interrrupted by this damn 'meanError' again\
...What would you do? Turn to GOOGLE (STACK overflow, or CHATGPT?), talk to the DUCK or walk to the KITCHEN? (you can always call a FRIEND for a quick fix)",
    "stack overflow": "You end up scrolling again on Stack Overflow, your most trusted friend on the web. There are tons of solutions \
exposed on many pages but, somehow, it's all gibberish, nothing is usable...At this point, be honest: you start building internal FRUSTRATION or \
you calmly turn to other ressources and STUDY some more? Maybe you ask a coder FRIEND (#COLLEAGUE) or turn to some CHATGPT consulting? (you could always SLEEP on it...)",
    "duck": "You look around and make eye contact with the rubber duck on your desk. You are well aware of the magic involved in \
RUBBER DUCKING. The question is: do you really believe in it? The duck looks back at you faithfully, listening...What are you going to do: try to EXPLAIN your coding problems \
to Donald or don't be a fool and re-consider your OPTIONS?",
    "rubber ducking": "In software engineering, rubber duck debugging (or rubberducking) is a method of debugging code by articulating a \
problem in spoken or written natural language. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer \
would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line by line, to the duck (press B+A+C+K, in that order with a fingers \
on the keyboard. Then with the same finger or another press <enter>...)",
    "kitchen": "Let's get some air in the lungs and refill your energy levels. What's the rush anyways? You walk \
to the kitchen slowly, thinking about what you will find there...You take the opportunity to drink a bit of water and \
as your eyes fixes a box on the counter with a big 'Merci' written on it... Steal/get some CHOCOLATE or \
BACK to work?",
    "tea": "You wipe away the brown from the corners of your smile and notice the water boiler. Now, how about preparing \
yourself a nice cup of TEA? Maybe eat another piece of CHOCOLATE? ..or BACK to work for some reason...???",
    "sandwich": "Waiting for the water to boil, you prepare your cup and check in the fridge for some cream while you \
are planning your next move: going BACK to work...   Also, you can't help but notice all the necessary ingredients to make yourself \
one of your favorite SANDWICH. Again: 'What's the rush, right? Very tempting. It would sure take your belly out of the equation in your next coding session...",
    "break": "There it is: true pleasure. A Happy brain in an Happy body. What more? Well, how about a little BREAK for \
digestion purposes? (or BACK to work.... Really??)",
    "after break": "Ouh, time passes so fast when your checking for new shoes on amazon! Fine, let's go BACK to coding, \
but not before you pass by the W.C., check your hair and your teeth in the mirror, put on a warm shirt, make yourself \
another TEA, grab some CHOCOLATE...",
    "call_colleague": "Your self esteem takes a hit as you push through the 'Pffffff', 'yeah, yeah' and 'I'm too busy right now'... \
Anyways, you end up sending your problematic code and getting a gitHub get request from your favorite colleague. \
Smart move buddy, you congratulate yourself for not wasting time and/or not learning much...",
    "call_friend": "After a couple of calls, someone from the inner circle picks up and laughs at you a little. \
You do your best to explain the matter at hand...and your friend gets half of it. During the exchange, he points you out to an obscure webChat \
where some likewise issues are being discussed. You thank your friend for nothing and start pasting every lines of code \
from the forum until one of them sticks! Lucky for you, those coders are geniuses and the meanError seems to have disappeared...for the moment. \
Hallelujah!! You praise the coding community and swear to your future self that you will one day take the time to understand that pasted code...",
    "chatgpt": "After a couple of tweeking in the prompt, the Truth appears before your eyes: Pure Code, so perfect: \
devoid of any console logging and predictable variable names. The code is unreadable but, once pasted, runs smooth like butter. \
Honestly, what kind of person would disrupt that super-natural flow of artificial beings helping each other so efficiently? \
Smart move. Just don't tell anyone what you've done and earn yourself some time to spend on more entertaining stuff! \
Life is not that hard right? Will you ever CODE again, QUIT this nonsensical absurdity of a mini game, or check updates \
on your coder's PROFILE?",
    "frustration": "HOOOOOOLLLY COW!!! Computers are so incredibly AUTISTIC! You realize at this instant how much you were not \
made to work in a mental institution...but you might become a patient if you let all this anger control yourself! \
You take a second to contemplate this issue: and decide to come BACK and evaluate this situation calmly, or, turn to \
the DARK side and express some of that accumulated tension physically?",
    "dark": "Something has got to give and various options are rapidly presenting themselves: you can SCREAM in a pillow, let a very long and very loud F-WORD out, \
SLAP something on the desk or just PUNCH that wall with all you've got...",
    "pillow": "After this mini crisis episode, you go and refresh your face in the bathroom. Once the mirror-check \
reflects your normal 'OK' face again, you come back to your post, take a deep breath and start to CODE again...",
    "cursing": "WAouuuuuh that felt good! Sometimes, cursing is all you've got...for now, you're 'OK' (are you? Let us know if you had ENOUGH?) but you can't shake the feeling that \
you might have been noticed by someone else, and that, makes you want to curse even more. Will you risk another very loud 'FUUU' ??",
    "study": "Zen as a bonsai, you turn to other websites and try not to deviate from the path too much...",
    "study2": "You take a couple of minutes to ponder your options: you can always let it go and SLEEP on it, \
see what tomorrow brings. Also you can OBSESS and stay on course until you make the code work or, \
look inward and see if you are not, in fact, building some kind of FRUSTRATION",
    "obsess": "OK, you got this. Knife between your teeth you try to make it work using the sheer power of your Will",
    "abandon": "You are failing and you know it. There must be a simple explanation, but it is out of reach for the moment. \
Time to lick you wounds, admit defeat and gather your strengh for the next fight. Another day, another code to write....what will you do? \
START AGAIN, meditate on your coder's PROFILE or just QUIT?",
    "sleep": "Time to get your 'Mojo' back, meditate, and experience the cycle of life again. Breathing in and out. This is no lazyness (or is it?). \
This is how the experienced thinker acts: trusting one's brain to classify all the data during its 'reboot phase' and eventually reveal the missing links...",
    "nap success": "What a difference a good nap makes! You haven't touched the keyboard and yet, you are already \
formulating solutions within a smile. Your refreshed self is winning, the rest bears its fruit. You feel wiser and a little more proficient at coding. How about that?\
 Hopefully it will work NEXT TIME. Or maybe you would like to check updates on your coder's PROFILE?",
    "punch": "You turn to that ugly wall next to the desk and hit it with your right fist. AOUCH!... Damn, \
you have hit precisely where the supporting beam was! Your hand hurts a little and the wall is somehow mocking you. \
What does this experience teaches you? That you need to 'CALM DOWN', or go the toolbox, get the HAMMER and bring that \
stupid wall down?",
    "strangle duck": "You put your hands around the neck of the duck. You start squeezing until you hear a \
'Kwaaaakkk'. Playing the rubber duck murderer makes you giggle and releases a bit of accumulated tension. You squeeze some more, \
and realize how childish you have become (...or have you? You're considering turning to the DARK side...) Now, where were we? \
Ah yeah! Donald... try to EXPLAIN your code again line by line, reconsider your OPTIONS or accept defeat and ABANDON?",
    "slap endgame": "OUch!!! The slapping went uncontrolled and your laptop gets a big hit. Screen of Death and broken glass, \
you are also bleeding at the wrist. What a mess!!! Seriously?? This couldn't have gone worse. \
You are dangerous. This mini game is booting you out as to avoid further material destruction. Good luck with your temper issues Pal!",
    "angry endgame": "With so much noise, someone calls the autorities on you. You get a serious warning and find yourself in such a state of \
anger and despair that you are rendered inoperable. You need to CALM DOWN! Seriously. \
This mini game is booting you out as to avoid further material destruction. Have a nice Life Buddy!",
    "autism": "Autism, also called autism spectrum disorder(ASD) or autism spectrum condition (ASC), is a neurodevelopmental disorder \
marked by restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and deficits in reciprocal social communication. Other common signs include perseverative \
interests, stereotypic body movements (stimming), rigid routines, hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input, and difficulty with social interaction \
and verbal and nonverbal communication. (type 'BACK' exactly, without any mistake or I will not understand!)",
    "success": "OH! You did it! WOW! Impressive. You do a little dance...and just between us: you know it's 3 a.m. right? \
Did you missed that call from your mother? You will probably be coding in bed also, good luck sleeping! \
START again because you are a Maniac or check updates on your coder's PROFILE together?",
    "duck success": "Incredible! Confessional Programming IS an actual working method for debugging and you are now \
living proof of it. Going back to the code, you find that hidden bug and make everything running smoothly again. You feel smart \
and adequate. TODO: Celebrate fully and check updates on your coder's PROFILE or on to the NEXT challenge??",
    "todo": "'To do', get it?"
